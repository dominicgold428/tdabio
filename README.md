Exploring TDA and its applications to biometrics

This is my current research topic for my PhD in Mathematics at Florida Atlantic University.

Introduction

Topological data analysis is an exciting new tool in the real of data analytics, and I am of the personal belief that it has extremely promising results combined with the topic of user authentication. 

Because TDA is robust to perturbations and rotations, it is the hope of this research project that we may encrypt user data and preform a TDA technique called persistent homology to obtain two persistence graphs. From there, the persistence graphs are expected to create a near-invariant graph (invariant to the encryption, up to some preset error variable).
